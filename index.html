        <p>In true KHN tradition, the two founders discovered a village, fortified it and settled nearby.<br>While it may not be the first village they found (this title goes to the appropriately-named Protochori), it was the most fitting of the area to settle around.<br>The population of the village, unable to defend itself even within the impenetratable walls, soon perished.<br>It was replaced months later when foreign townsmen were relocated to the area and bred with one another by the serverians. To protect them from their own careleesness they were locked inside their residencies.<br>The village thereupon underwent a visual upgrade, which is continuing to this day, with special care taken to preserve its original structures.</p>
        <p>Future plans for the town include the completiom of its visual upgrade and the construction of new buildings beneath, above and around the area.</p>

          <img class="centerimg" src="img/java_screenshots/mansion.png">
        <p>During its infancy, KHN5 saw the settlement of its two founders next to KHNochori.<br>They began building their home, a spacious two-story mansion with each floor available to each founding member.<br>Construction of the house lasted several months and underwent a few revisions, most notable being the replacement of cobblestone with stone bricks early into the process, the renovation of both floors in July of 2020 and the upgrade of the garden in [τότε]<br>. An attic and an underground chestroom were added as storage systems for both dwellers, with other additions including a brewing room and a conduit-equipped swimming pool.<br>
        The design and initial cobblestone material of the house were both based on the same exact building carried on through the KHNs with minor upgrades conducted per iteration. The last, however, would be the greatest upgrade done to this building.</p>
        <p>Future plans include the construction of an underground aquarium, the completion of the basement and villager trading hall as well as further visual upgrades to the building and the garden.</p>

As we enter the second season of the server, construction for this castle is still undergoing.</p>
